This project investigates patterns in the use of Davidson College's Math and Science Center (MSC). The MSC is a great resource for STEM students in need of extra help, but it can often be hard to get that help during busy hours. Using a Raspberry Pi, data was collected on the level of activity in the MSC over the course of a week. The results provide insight into the best times to visit and avoid the MSC.
