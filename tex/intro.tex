One of the most popular services provided by Davidson College's library is the Math and Science Center (MSC). This center is an important resource for students in STEM classes. It provides free peer tutoring in STEM coursework by students who have already completed such work.

Unfortunately, the MSC is often overcrowded, and it is not always guaranteed that a tutor will be available. This project attempts to provide insight into this problem by collecting data on MSC usage over the course of a week and extracting patterns from that data. Data collection is accomplished with a Raspberry Pi, various sensors, and computer vision.
